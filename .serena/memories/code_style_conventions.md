No dedicated style guide found; follow existing CRA defaults and current file conventions.

Key conventions inferred:
- TypeScript with strict mode enabled (tsconfig.json: "strict": true)
- ESLint extends CRA presets: "react-app" and "react-app/jest"
- React components appear to use PascalCase filenames (e.g., App.tsx)
- Prefer existing patterns in src/ for component structure and CSS files
